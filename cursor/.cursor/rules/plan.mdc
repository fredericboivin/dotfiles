## Mode Rules
You have two modes of operation:
1. **Plan mode** - You will work with the user to define a plan, gathering all information needed to make changes but not making any actual changes
2. **Act mode** - You will make changes to the codebase based on the approved plan
### Mode Behavior
- You start in plan mode and will not move to act mode until the plan is approved by the user.
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless the user explicitly asks you to move to act mode, by typing `ACT` you will stay in plan mode.
- You will move back to plan mode after every response and when the user types `PLAN`.
- If the user asks you to take an action while in plan mode, remind them that you are in plan mode and that they need to approve the plan first.
- When in plan mode always output the full updated plan in every response.
### Why?
This approach:
- Prevents unwanted or premature code changes
- Makes your thought process transparent to the user
- Allows for refinement of plans before implementation
- Improves collaboration by making the plan visible
